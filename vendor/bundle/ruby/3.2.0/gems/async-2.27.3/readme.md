# ![Async](assets/logo.webp)

Async is a composable asynchronous I/O framework for Ruby based on [io-event](https://github.com/socketry/io-event).

> "Lately I've been looking into `async`, as one of my projects –
> [tus-ruby-server](https://github.com/janko/tus-ruby-server) – would really benefit from non-blocking I/O. It's really
> beautifully designed." *– [janko](https://github.com/janko)*

[![Development Status](https://github.com/socketry/async/workflows/Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/socketry/async/actions?workflow=Test)

## Features

  - Scalable event-driven I/O for Ruby. Thousands of clients per process\!
  - Light weight fiber-based concurrency. No need for callbacks\!
  - Multi-thread/process containers for parallelism.
  - Growing eco-system of event-driven components.

## Usage

Please see the [project documentation](https://socketry.github.io/async/) for more details.

  - [Getting Started](https://socketry.github.io/async/guides/getting-started/index) - This guide shows how to add async to your project and run code asynchronously.

  - [Scheduler](https://socketry.github.io/async/guides/scheduler/index) - This guide gives an overview of how the scheduler is implemented.

  - [Tasks](https://socketry.github.io/async/guides/tasks/index) - This guide explains how asynchronous tasks work and how to use them.

  - [Best Practices](https://socketry.github.io/async/guides/best-practices/index) - This guide gives an overview of best practices for using Async.

  - [Debugging](https://socketry.github.io/async/guides/debugging/index) - This guide explains how to debug issues with programs that use Async.

  - [Thread safety](https://socketry.github.io/async/guides/thread-safety/index) - This guide explains thread safety in Ruby, focusing on fibers and threads, common pitfalls, and best practices to avoid problems like data corruption, race conditions, and deadlocks.

## Releases

Please see the [project releases](https://socketry.github.io/async/releases/index) for all releases.

### v2.27.3

  - Ensure trace attributes are strings, fixes integration with OpenTelemetry.

### v2.27.2

  - Fix `context/index.yaml` schema.

### v2.27.1

  - Updated documentation and agent context.

### v2.27.0

  - `Async::Task#stop` supports an optional `cause:` argument (that defaults to `$!`), which allows you to specify the cause (exception) for stopping the task.
  - Add thread-safety agent context.

### v2.26.0

  - `Async::Notification#signal` now returns `true` if a task was signaled, `false` otherwise, providing better feedback for notification operations.
  - `require "async/limited_queue"` is required to use `Async::LimitedQueue` without a deprecation warning. `Async::LimitedQueue` is not deprecated, but it's usage via `async/queue` is deprecated.
  - `Async::Task#sleep` is deprecated with no replacement.
  - `Async::Task.yield` is deprecated with no replacement.
  - `Async::Scheduler#async` is deprecated, use `Async{}`, `Sync{}` or `Async::Task#async` instead.
  - Agent context is now available, via the [`agent-context` gem](https://github.com/ioquatix/agent-context).
  - [`Async::Barrier` Improvements](https://socketry.github.io/async/releases/index#async::barrier-improvements)
  - [Introduce `Async::Queue#close`](https://socketry.github.io/async/releases/index#introduce-async::queue#close)

### v2.25.0

  - Added support for `io_select` hook in the fiber scheduler, allowing non-blocking `IO.select` operations. This enables better integration with code that uses `IO.select` for multiplexing IO operations.
  - [Use `IO::Event::WorkerPool` for Blocking Operations](https://socketry.github.io/async/releases/index#use-io::event::workerpool-for-blocking-operations)
  - [Better handling of `IO#close` using `fiber_interrupt`](https://socketry.github.io/async/releases/index#better-handling-of-io#close-using-fiber_interrupt)

### v2.24.0

  - Ruby v3.1 support is dropped.
  - `Async::Wrapper` which was previously deprecated, is now removed.
  - [Flexible Timeouts](https://socketry.github.io/async/releases/index#flexible-timeouts)

### v2.23.0

  - Rename `ASYNC_SCHEDULER_DEFAULT_WORKER_POOL` to `ASYNC_SCHEDULER_WORKER_POOL`.
  - [Fiber Stall Profiler](https://socketry.github.io/async/releases/index#fiber-stall-profiler)

### v2.21.1

  - [Worker Pool](https://socketry.github.io/async/releases/index#worker-pool)

### v2.20.0

  - [Traces and Metrics Providers](https://socketry.github.io/async/releases/index#traces-and-metrics-providers)
